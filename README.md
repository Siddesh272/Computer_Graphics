## To Draw a SOLID and DOTTED line in TURBO C using Digital Differential Analyser algorithm (DDA).
### In computer graphics, a digital differential analyzer (DDA) is hardware or software used for interpolation of variables over an interval between start and end point. DDAs are used for rasterization of lines, triangles and polygons. They can be extended to non linear functions, such as perspective correct texture mapping, quadratic curves, and traversing voxels.
